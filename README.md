# Leetcode-Learner
### A Leetcode chrome extension that can be used to help learn/build an understanding for problems a user struggles with.  

## How it works

1. Work through leetcode problems and find one you struggle with
1. Click on the extension and hit the "Add to redo" button
    1. The extension will then create multiple lists that each have a different name where the name is the day to revisit the problem, for example: 12/10/20
1. Check back in on the day assigned to revisit that problem and solve it!

## Planned Features
1. Custom list naming -> right now lists all conform to MM/DD/YY
1. Ability to specify custom patterns -> Current pattern is resolve it 1 day later, 2 days later, 4th days later, 8th days later, 15th days later and 30th days later
1. The ability to clean out/delete all old lists with the click of a button
1. Button to go to today's list of problems to redo
1. Google calendar integration? -> Could hlep declutter the list of leetcode lists
